  <h2>Data and Energy Flow</h2>

  <h3>Data and Energy Flow Diagram</h3>
  <img src="Images\Data_energy_flow_diagram.png" alt="Data and Energy Flow Diagram">

  <h3>Explanation</h3>
  <p>
      This diagram illustrates the interaction between the data and energy systems in the boat. 
      User inputs waypoints, which are processed by the Arduino Uno, acting as the central controller.
      The GPS module provides real-time location data to the Arduino Uno, which calculates the current and target headings.
      Based on this information, the Arduino sends motor speed and direction signals (via PWM) to the ESCs controlling the brushless motors. 
      The energy flow highlights the power distribution from the batteries to the individual components, ensuring consistent operation.

    <h2>Evolution of the Code and Circuit Design</h2>
    
    <h3>Code Evolution</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Initial Logic:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Movement was determined by the boatâ€™s position relative to the final destination.</li>
                <li>If the boat moved past the destination on either latitude or longitude, it would switch direction (left/right).</li>
                <li><em>Issue:</em> This caused the boat to take inefficient routes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Second Iteration:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Tracked previous and current coordinates to calculate if the boat was moving closer to the destination along latitude or longitude.</li>
                <li>Flipped direction if the boat got further away.</li>
                <li><em>Issue:</em> The boat failed to account for situations where it faced the wrong direction entirely.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Final Iteration:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Calculated the current heading (based on previous and current coordinates) and compared it to the target heading (current to destination coordinates).</li>
                <li>If the heading deviated beyond 45 degrees, the boat corrected its course.</li>
                <li>Added logic to switch direction based on proximity to the target.</li>
                <li>Removed waypoints logic since heading logic was precise enough</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Final Code Design Elements</h3>
    <br />
    <p><strong>Code Repository:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/bellesea/boat/">GitHub Link</a></p>
    <br />
    <ul>
        <li>Initial delay of 2 min to allow user to row into the water and place the boat.</li>
        <li>Saves the starting coordinates when it is placed in the water.</li>
        <li>Runs a navigation cycle every 5 seconds:
            <ol>
                <li>Calculates whether the current boat is further away from the destination by longitude or latitude.</li>
                <li>Taking the coordinate that is the result from above, checks if it is moving closer or further away along this coordinate.</li>
                <li>If it's moving further away, turn 90 degrees left/right depending on it's relative location.</li>
                <li>Adjusts heading by turning left/right if it deviates beyond 30 degrees of the target heading.</li>
                <li>Checks distance to destination (in meters) </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Within 15 meters of the final destination, turn in a circle for 20 seconds and update the destination coordinates to return to the start point.</li>
        <li>Stops when it reaches it's starting destination.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Troubleshooting Errors</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Unreliable GPS Connection:</strong>
            <ul><li>Solved by soldering wires to stabilize the GPS signal.</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Broken Compass:</strong>
            <ul><li>Adapted navigation logic to use GPS data only by calculating the boatâ€™s heading from current and previous positions.</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Overflow Issues:</strong>
            <ul><li>GPS stopped sending updates when variables were initialized within the main loop. Moved initialization outside the loop to resolve this.</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Drift:</strong>
            <ul><li>Used heading calculations between current and previous positions to detect drift and correct the course.</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Motors not responsive:</strong>
          <ul><li>Set motor speed to zero at the start of the set-up code before giving the motors its actual speed.</li></ul>
        </li>

        </ul>
      
        <p><strong>Step-by-Step Justification:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Voltage Compatibility:</strong>
            <p>The motor can handle 3-6S Lipo batteries. A 3S battery has a nominal voltage of 11.1V, which is within the motor's operating range. This ensures that the motor will run efficiently without being over or under-powered.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Current Draw:</strong>
            <p>The batteryâ€™s continuous discharge capability is calculated as follows:</p>
            <p>\[
              I_{\text{max}} = \text{Capacity} \times \text{Discharge Rate} = 2.2 \, \text{Ah} \times 35 \, \text{C} = 77 \, \text{A}
            \]</p>
            <p>The motor requires a maximum continuous current of \( 39 \, \text{A} \), and the battery can provide up to \( 77 \, \text{A} \), which is sufficient.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Power Requirements:</strong>
            <p>The current required to provide \( 865 \, \text{W} \) of power at \( 11.1 \, \text{V} \) is:</p>
            <p>\[
              I = \frac{P}{V} = \frac{865 \, \text{W}}{11.1 \, \text{V}} \approx 78 \, \text{A}
            \]</p>
            <p>The batteryâ€™s burst capacity allows handling such current bursts:</p>
            <p>\[
              I_{\text{burst}} = 2.2 \, \text{Ah} \times 70 \, \text{C} = 154 \, \text{A}
            \]</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Internal Resistance:</strong>
            <p>Voltage drop due to internal resistance is given by:</p>
            <p>\[
              V_{\text{drop}} = I \times R = 39 \, \text{A} \times 0.011 \, \Omega = 0.429 \, \text{V}
            \]</p>
            <p>The actual voltage available to the motor is:</p>
            <p>\[
              V_{\text{actual}} = 11.1 \, \text{V} - 0.429 \, \text{V} \approx 10.671 \, \text{V}
            \]</p>
            <p>This minimal drop ensures efficient power delivery.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
        <p>The OVONIC 3S Lipo Battery 35C (Burst 70C) 2200mAh 11.1V meets and exceeds the motor's current and power requirements while also providing sufficient voltage and low internal resistance for efficient operation. This makes it an appropriate and reliable choice for powering your motor.</p>

    <h2>Prototype</h2>
    
    <p>
      Before constructing the final autonomous GPS-guided boat, we developed a working prototype to test and configure our code, electrical systems, and overall functionality. The prototype allowed us to identify potential issues and refine our design for optimal performance. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Materials and Construction</h3>
    <p>
      The prototype was constructed using accessible and cost-effective materials while still incorporating key components to simulate real-world conditions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hulls:</strong> The hulls were made from PVC tubes cut in half lengthwise, providing a lightweight, buoyant structure.</li>
      <li><strong>Electronics Housing:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>An acrylic box was laser-cut and assembled using acrylic glue for rigidity and electrical tape for sealing.</li>
          <li>As an added precaution, the electronic components inside the acrylic box were placed within a Ziploc bag to ensure protection against water ingress.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Platform:</strong> A flat platform made from 1/4-inch plywood was mounted on the hulls, providing a stable surface for the acrylic box and other components.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <p>
      The prototype incorporated the following real components to mimic the final design:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Brushless motors and ESCs to test thrust and propulsion control.</li>
      <li>OVONIC 3S Lipo battery to evaluate power delivery and capacity.</li>
      <li>GPS module for navigation logic and heading determination.</li>
      <li>Arduino microcontroller for implementing and debugging the control algorithms.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Purpose and Testing</h3>
    <p>
      The prototype served as a critical tool for testing the following systems:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Code Configuration:</strong> The prototype allowed us to evaluate and refine our navigation algorithms, ensuring the boat could calculate headings, correct drift, and approach waypoints effectively.</li>
      <li><strong>Power and Propulsion:</strong> By using the real motors and battery, we confirmed that the power system met the operational requirements and could handle continuous operation without overheating or significant voltage drops.</li>
      <li><strong>Waterproofing:</strong> The sealed acrylic box and additional Ziploc bag protection ensured that no water reached the sensitive electronics during extended testing in water.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Learnings and Refinements</h3>
    <p>
      The prototype revealed several insights that informed our final design:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The PVC hulls provided sufficient buoyancy, confirming the feasibility of our dual-hull approach.</li>
      <li>Waterproofing with electrical tape was not as reliable as anticipated, leading us to adopt fiberglass and epoxy for the final design.</li>
      <li>Placement of the GPS module on the acrylic platform minimized interference and improved data accuracy.</li>
      <li>The Ziploc bag provided excellent secondary protection, which we plan to incorporate into future iterations for redundancy.</li>
    </ul>
